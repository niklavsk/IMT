<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The riverside town of Houtong, Taiwan, fell into feline celebrity by accident. Houtong once sat on top of Taiwan's largest coal mine. When the mine closed in the 1990s, the town's population dwindled. Then some new, furry residents arrived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Houtong Coal Mine Ecological Park (<em>Houtong Road, Ruifang District, New Taipei City; +886 2 2497 4143</em>) was established to showcase the mining heritage of the town and surrounding hills. But visitors mostly come to photograph the 120 or so playful stray cats, who laze around the Cat Village and soak up the fuss - and inevitable treats.</p>
